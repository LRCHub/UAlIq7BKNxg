[00:08.74] Aw, man! Hahahaha
[00:17.24] 
[00:12.79] I wake up early in the morning, make a ghast weep (Aah)
[00:16.52] It's like I'm in the nether, 'cause I can't sleep (Frick)
[00:19.64] In case you got amnesia, man, I want that blue stuff (Ooh)

[00:26.35] I'm at Y 12, baby, 'cause that's where it's found (Found)
[00:29.63] I'm so fricking low key that I'm underground (Ground)
[00:32.93] I got big dreams of tearing out some big seams
[00:36.39] So, time to grind and hit the big leagues, yeah
[00:59.89] 
[00:39.05] I mine all day (Ah), I mine all night (Yeah)
[00:42.35] I mine non-stop 'til those diamonds are inside
[00:45.57] And I'll mine all stone (Ah) 'til I'm all alone (Ah)

[01:12.42] 
[00:52.31] I mine all day (Ah), I mine all night (Yeah)
[00:55.71] I mine non-stop 'til those diamonds are inside
[00:58.84] And I mine your house (What?), I mine your mom (Hey!)
[01:02.36] I mine my tears 'til the break of dawn

[01:10.23] Bet you don't have the biggest ball the world has seen
[01:12.81] (Ooh) Yeah, you'd think I'd be satisfied, no, I want more
[01:41.31] 
[01:16.17] But you have every single thing that you can
[01:18.22] Bitch, I want more!
[01:19.73] 'Cause I got hoes (For life), I got bitches (What up, Sven?)
[01:49.73] 
[01:23.63] I got iron (In my house), I got millions (In real life)
[01:26.78] I got the best life, it's easy to see (Woo)
[01:29.65] And a hundred million people agree, because (Haha!)
[01:55.15]

[01:35.64] I mine non-stop 'til those diamonds are inside
[01:38.89] And I'll mine all stone (Ah) 'til I'm all alone (That's right)
[01:42.37] I mine all the time, but can't find what I want (Where is it?)
[02:13.37]

[02:02.36] Sir, sir, I think we hit bedrock
[02:05.36] What does that mean?

[02:18.51] This shit is way too easy (Oh)
[02:20.35] I swear it doesn't please me (Oh)
[02:21.98] I'm like a reaper gleaning
[02:23.23] When I take my pick and squeeze it
[02:40.23]
